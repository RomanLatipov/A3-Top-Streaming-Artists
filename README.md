I changed IDE's, so now I'm using Sublime Text instead of DrJava, which gives me a little bit for flexability in terms of syntax. For this assignment, instead of using a File object to search through the csv file I used BufferedReader which fixed the massive issue of the program crashing after lines 81/82 so now I can traverse through the entire csv file.
